## What is Bonsai.Sgen?

`Bonsai.Sgen` is a code generator tool for the [Bonsai programming language](https://bonsai-rx.org/). It leverages [`json-schema`](https://json-schema.org/) as a standard to represent [record-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)) structures, and automatically generates Bonsai-compatible isomorphic operators to create and manipulate these objects.
